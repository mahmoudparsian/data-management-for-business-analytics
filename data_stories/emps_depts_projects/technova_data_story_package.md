# Employee-Department-Project Analytics â€“ Data Story, Schema, Sample Data, and Queries

## Data Story (Business Requirement)

TechNova is a global technology consultancy that employs specialists from over ten countries. Each **employee** belongs to exactly one **department** (such as Engineering, Marketing, or HR), which determines their career development path and reporting structure. Departments manage budgets, track headcounts, and often need insights into staffing distribution across geographies. Management wants to know which departments are growing fastest, how average salaries differ by country, and which teams are most effective at retaining talent.

Employees also work on multiple **projects** throughout the year, reflecting the dynamic, cross-functional nature of consulting. Projects can be local or global, and often involve collaboration across departments. Leadership needs to understand which employees are working on the most projects, how project workloads are distributed by department, and which projects are contributing most to billable hours. By analyzing the links between employees, departments, and projects, TechNova can better allocate resources, plan future hiring, and identify rising stars within the workforce.

**18. Highest paid employee in each department**

solution-1:

```sql
SELECT d.dept_name,e.first_name,e.salary FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id=d.dept_id WHERE e.salary=(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept_id=d.dept_id);
```

solution-2:

```sql
WITH dept_max AS (
    SELECT dept_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT d.dept_name,
       e.first_name,
       e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
JOIN dept_max dm ON e.dept_id = dm.dept_id
                AND e.salary = dm.max_salary;
```

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:

	1.	The dept_max CTE computes the maximum salary per department.
	
	2.	Then we join employees and departments with this CTE.
	
	3.	The condition e.salary = dm.max_salary ensures we only return 
	    employees who earn the max salary in their department.
