## ðŸ”¹ 10 Intermediate Queries (CTEs + Ranking)

**21. With CTE: Find customers ranked by total spend.**
```sql
WITH spend AS (
  SELECT c.name, SUM(o.paid_price) AS total_spend
  FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id=c.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.name
)
SELECT name, total_spend,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS spend_rank
FROM spend;
```

**22. With CTE: Rank products by total revenue.**
```sql
WITH prod_rev AS (
  SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.paid_price) AS revenue
  FROM orders o
  JOIN products p ON o.product_id=p.product_id
  GROUP BY p.product_name
)
SELECT product_name, revenue,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank_revenue
FROM prod_rev;
```

**23. With CTE: Top customer per country by spend.**
```sql
WITH spend AS (
  SELECT c.country, c.name, SUM(o.paid_price) AS total_spend
  FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id=c.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.country, c.name
