# MySQL 101 Lab Exercise Sheet

## Sample Schema

We will create a simple database called **school** with one table **students**.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school;
USE school;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(5),
    country VARCHAR(30)
);
```

### Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO students VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 20, 'A', 'USA'),
(2, 'Bob', 22, 'B', 'CANADA'),
(3, 'Charlie', 21, 'A', 'USA'),
(4, 'Diana', 23, 'C', 'GERMANY'),
(5, 'Ethan', 20, 'B', 'MEXICO'),
(6, 'Fiona', 22, 'A', 'USA'),
(7, 'George', 24, 'B', 'ITALY'),
(8, 'Hannah', 21, 'C', 'USA'),
(9, 'Ivan', 23, 'A', 'CANADA'),
(10, 'Julia', 22, 'B', 'GERMANY');
```
