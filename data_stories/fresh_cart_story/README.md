Let's create a data story (in 2 paragraphs) first (which will 
eventually translated into 2 to 3 tables). This is kind of a 
business requirement. The story should be compelling.

Then design the tables schemas (2 to 3 tables) in MySQL.

Then have an INSERT INTO statements (between 30 to 50 rows),
realistic data.

Then come up with 60 SQL queries in English/SQL, which
20 of them are basic, 20 of them are basic-to-intermediate,
and finally 20 intermediate.

All of these in a single markdown format as a downloadable.
