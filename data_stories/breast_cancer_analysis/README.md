# SEER Breast Cancer Data

### Abstract

		This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained 
		from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of 
		the NCI, which provides information on population-based 
		cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients 
		with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer 
		(SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) 
		diagnosed in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumor size, 
		examined regional LNs, regional positive LNs, and patients 
		whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; 
		thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.
