Okay: this is the scenario: I will be teaching a 7 weeks Introduction 
to Database Management (using MySQL): I am going to assume that they 
have never take any database course and they have not used SQL at all. 
I think, with your help, I have created enough labs/demos, but I want 
to have some weekly quizzes (week-1, week-2, ..., week-3). I want to 
have a weekly quiz with 10 questions on each quiz. Can you help me on 
this to create 7 quizzes in markdown format (student version and instructor 
version with solutions).  Befor you generate these quizzes, do you have 
any suggestions/questions to make these as realistic as possible.

That sounds excellent, Mahmoud 👏 You’ve got the labs and demos covered, 
and weekly quizzes will be the perfect way to reinforce the concepts step by step.

Before I generate the 7 quizzes (10 questions each, student & instructor 
versions), here are a few suggestions and clarifying questions to make them 
as realistic and aligned with your course:

⸻

✅ Suggestions
    1.    Progression in difficulty
    •    Week 1–2: Basics → schema concepts, primary/foreign keys, SELECT, simple WHERE.
    •    Week 3–4: Aggregation & GROUP BY, JOINs.
    •    Week 5: Subqueries, WITH, ranking functions.
    •    Week 6: Transactions, constraints, data integrity, normalization basics.
    •    Week 7: Capstone-type quiz with integrated queries across multiple tables.
    2.    Use familiar schemas
    •    Students often get overwhelmed if each quiz uses a totally different schema.
    •    Suggestion: stick to 2–3 recurring schemas across the weeks:
    •    A Students / Courses / Enrollments schema (education domain).
    •    A Books / Customers / Stores / Transactions schema (commerce domain).
    •    A Cats / Breeds schema (fun, smaller, for lightweight practice).
    3.    Mix formats
    •    Multiple choice (conceptual, e.g., “What does PRIMARY KEY mean?”).
    •    Short-answer SQL queries (e.g., “Find all students from USA”).
    •    “Fix the error” style (students debug a broken SQL query).
    •    Small reasoning tasks (e.g., “Why is normalization important?”).
    4.    Instructor vs Student versions
    •    Student version: English-only or with incomplete SQL.
    •    Instructor version: full SQL answers + explanations.

⸻

❓ Clarifying Questions for You
    1.    Level of students – Are these undergraduates (business/CS mix) or graduate students? 
          This helps me tune the depth of SQL/ranking/transactions.
    2.    Assessment type – Do you want quizzes to be open SQL writing (students type queries) 
          or more conceptual multiple choice / fill-in-the-blanks?
    3.    Environment – Will they be running queries on MySQL Workbench or submitting written 
          answers (e.g., through Canvas/Blackboard)?
    4.    Focus topics – Should I include some theory (e.g., normalization, ER diagrams, 
          ACID properties) in addition to practical SQL?
    5.    Final exam prep – Do you want Week 7 to feel like a mini final exam with 
          integrated schema queries?

⸻

👉 Once I know these, I can design 7 quizzes, 10 questions each, in two Markdown sets:
    •    quiz_week_X_students.md
    •    quiz_week_X_instructor.md (with solutions).

Would you like me to balance conceptual vs SQL practice (e.g., 30% theory, 70% SQL), 
or go heavily SQL-based since it’s hands-on MySQL?

I have answered your 5 questions: 

1.    Level of students – entry graduate students, but no prerequisite 
2.    Assessment type – SQL writing and conceptual multiple choice 
3.    Environment – submitting written answers (e.g., through Canvas/Blackboard)
4.    Focus topics – just practical SQL
5.    Final exam prep – yes

Perfect 👌 Thanks for clarifying, Mahmoud. Based on your answers, 
here’s how I propose we structure the 7 weekly quizzes:

⸻

📅 Quiz Design Plan

Week 1: Introduction & Basics
    •    Focus: basic database concepts, simple SELECT, filtering with WHERE.
    •    Mix of MCQs (conceptual: PK, FK, data types) + short SQL writing.

Week 2: Filtering & Sorting
    •    Focus: operators (BETWEEN, LIKE, IN), ORDER BY, DISTINCT.
    •    SQL writing + debug/fix-the-query questions.

Week 3: Aggregation & GROUP BY
    •    Focus: COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING.
    •    Writing queries with aggregate functions.

Week 4: JOINs
    •    Focus: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, identifying missing data, multi-table queries.

Week 5: Subqueries & WITH
    •    Focus: subqueries inside WHERE, IN, EXISTS, CTEs.
    •    Introduce ranking (ROW_NUMBER, RANK).

Week 6: Advanced SQL
    •    Focus: constraints, integrity checks, multi-level subqueries, set operations (UNION).
    •    More complex query building.

Week 7: Capstone / Final Exam Prep
    •    Integrated quiz with queries across multiple tables, mimicking a mini-exam.
    •    Includes real-world problem statements.

⸻

📂 Deliverables

I’ll create two Markdown sets:
    1.    Student version → 7 files (quiz_week_X_students.md) with questions only.
    2.    Instructor version → 7 files (quiz_week_X_instructor.md) with questions + SQL answers.

Each quiz will have 10 questions, a mix of:
    •    3 MCQs (conceptual reinforcement)
    •    7 SQL writing tasks

⸻

⚡ Question for you before I generate:
Would you like me to stick to one schema throughout 
(e.g., Students–Courses–Enrollments) for consistency, 
or rotate schemas (e.g., Week 1–3 students/courses, 
Week 4–6 books/customers/transactions, Week 7 integrated 
exam with both)?

This will affect realism and variety.

rotate schemas (e.g., Week 1–3 students/courses, 
Week 4–6 books/customers/transactions, Week 7 
integrated exam with both)

Excellent choice 🎯 — rotating schemas will keep 
it fresh and realistic while reinforcing the fact 
that SQL skills transfer across domains. Here’s the 
final quiz plan with schema mapping and focus:

⸻

📅 Weekly Quiz Plan

Schema 1 (Weeks 1–3): Students / Courses / Enrollments

students(student_id, first_name, last_name, email, country, age)
courses(course_id, course_code, course_name, credits, department)
enrollments(enrollment_id, student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, grade)

    •    Week 1: Basic SELECT, WHERE, simple filters (Students table heavy).
    •    Week 2: Filtering, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, multi-column WHERE.
    •    Week 3: Aggregation (COUNT, AVG), GROUP BY, HAVING.

⸻

Schema 2 (Weeks 4–6): Books / Customers / Stores / Transactions

stores(store_id, store_location, city, country)
customers(customer_id, name, email, gender, age, city, country)
books(book_id, ISBN, title, author, category, published_date)
transactions(sale_id, store_id, book_id, customer_id, purchase_date, price)

    •    Week 4: JOINs across customers, books, and stores.
    •    Week 5: Subqueries & WITH (e.g., top 3 books per category).
    •    Week 6: Advanced queries — multiple joins, UNION, constraints.

⸻

Week 7: Capstone (Integrated Exam Prep)
    •    Combines both schemas into one quiz.
    •    Problem-driven: e.g., “Find students who never bought a book,” “Find the best-selling department and its students,” etc.
    •    Mix of conceptual + SQL, with final exam feel.

⸻

📂 Deliverables

I’ll generate:
    •    Student version (7 files): quiz_week1_students.md … quiz_week7_students.md
    •    Instructor version (7 files): quiz_week1_instructor.md … quiz_week7_instructor.md

Each quiz has 10 questions:
    •    3 MCQs (conceptual but practical — PK/FK, constraints, relational thinking).
    •    7 SQL tasks (progressively harder).

⸻

👉 Next Step:
I can now generate all 14 quiz files (7×2) and package them into one downloadable zip (with a clear folder structure).

Do you want me to also include a README.md with:
    •    Schema diagrams,
    •    Weekly topics focus,
    •    Instructions for students (e.g., “Run queries in MySQL Workbench”),
so they have context when attempting the quizzes?

Perfect 🙌 — here’s the plan for the final deliverable:
