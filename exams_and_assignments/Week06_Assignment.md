# Week 6 Assignment â€“ Subqueries & WITH (12 Tasks)

## Schema
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS depts;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS emps;

CREATE TABLE depts (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(40)
);

CREATE TABLE emps (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(40),
  dept_id INT,
  salary DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES depts(dept_id)
);
```

## Sample Data
```sql
INSERT INTO depts VALUES
(10,'Engineering'),
(20,'Sales'),
(30,'HR'),
(40, 'Business'),
(50, 'IT');

INSERT INTO emps VALUES
(1,'Alice',10,120000),
(2,'Bob',10,90000),
(3,'Carol',20,80000),
(4,'Dan',20,95000),
(5,'Eva',30,70000),
(6,'Adam',10,220000),
(7,'Dara',10,190000),
(8,'Candy',20,180000),
(9,'David',20,90000),
(10,'Emma',20,80000),

(12,'Parviz',10,90000),
(13,'Jenny',30,80000),
(14,'Jeb',30,95000),
(15,'Javid',30,70000),
(16,'Max',10,220000),
(17,'Mo',10,170000);

```

## Tasks

1) Employees earning above overall average salary (subquery).  

2) Departments with avg salary > 90k (subquery + GROUP BY).  

3) For each department, list employees whose salary > dept average (correlated). 
 
4) Count of employees per department using a subquery in FROM.  

5) Use `WITH` to compute dept averages, then select employees above that. 

6) Highest-paid employee per department (subquery with MAX). 
 
7) Departments with at least 2 employees (subquery with HAVING). 
 
8) Employees in departments that have someone earning > 100k. 
 
9) Departments with no employees (anti-join via NOT EXISTS). 
 
10) Employees whose salary is in the top 2 overall (LIMIT in subquery).  

11) Reuse a CTE to compute global average and list above-average employees. 
 
12) Show department and number of employees using a CTE, then filter count >= 2.
