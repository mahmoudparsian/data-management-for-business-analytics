# 📊 My First Data Analysis Project with MySQL 

Hi there 👋! I'm super excited to share my first-ever data analysis project using MySQL. I did this just for fun to sharpen my SQL skills and instincts 🧠.

I found a sample Superstore Orders dataset on the Internet containing historical transactional data from a fictional supermarket store. The dataset includes order details like dates, shipping information, customer names, product details, sales, profits, costs, etc. It covers orders from 2012-2015.

I loaded this dataset into a MySQL database and ran some queries to analyze the data - no specific business requirements, just following my curiosity! 🤓

Here are some key findings from exploring this rich sample dataset:

- 💰 The total sales, profit, and quantity sold across all orders
- 📈 Sales, profit, and quantity trends over time by quarter - so cool to see the seasonality! 
- 🌟 Identified the top sales quarter for each year
- 🏆 Top selling and most profitable product categories and sub-categories
- 🗺️ Regional sales and profit breakdown
- 💼 Most valuable customer segments 
- 🔝 Top selling and profitable individual products
- 🛒 Impact of discounts on sales and profit
- ⚖️ Shipping costs and impact on profit 
- ✉️ Distribution of order priorities
- 👥 Top customers by total sales and profit 
- 🤝 Customer buying patterns - orders, average order size
- 🎯 RFM analysis to identify best customers

I really enjoyed getting my hands dirty with MySQL to uncover insights from this sample supermarket data. This little project has made me even more excited to learn more data skills and tackle larger datasets! ✨

Let me know if you have any other feedback on my analysis!
