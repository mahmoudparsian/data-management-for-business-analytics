There is nothing much to do with this almost clean 
dataset (at least as this project is concerned). 
Weâ€™ll convert the datatype of the order_date and 
ship_date columns from VARCHAR to DATE.

I did this by,

Adding a new column called order_date_new
Update the values in this new column by converting 
the dates in VARCHAR to DATE using STR_TO_DATE function in MySQL


-- change order_date datatype from STRING to DATE
ALTER TABLE sales ADD (order_date_new DATE);
UPDATE sales SET order_date_new = STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
ALTER TABLE Sales DROP COLUMN order_date;
ALTER TABLE sales RENAME COLUMN order_date_new TO order_date;

-- change ship_date datatype from STRING to DATE
ALTER TABLE sales ADD (ship_date_new DATE);
UPDATE sales SET ship_date_new = STR_TO_DATE(ship_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
ALTER TABLE Sales DROP COLUMN ship_date;
ALTER TABLE sales RENAME COLUMN ship_date_new TO ship_date;

The above two queries will alter the table to perform the datatype conversion. 
The resulting table is as below.

Q2: Which states had the maximum and minimum sales in 2017?

Since this question demands the names of states that 
had both maximum and minimum sales respectively in 2017, 
we need to give the answer in the same output table. 
Letâ€™s achieve this by writing two sub queries and 
then union them as below.

(SELECT state, FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales 
FROM Sales
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT state, FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales 
FROM Sales
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY 2 ASC
LIMIT 1);

mysql> (SELECT state, FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales
    -> FROM Sales
    -> WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
    -> GROUP BY state
    -> ORDER BY 2 DESC

    -> UNION
    -> (SELECT state, FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales
    -> FROM Sales
    -> WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
    -> GROUP BY state
    -> ORDER BY 2 ASC
    -> LIMIT 1);

Q3) What is the average sales in each of the region in 2017?

SELECT region, 
       FLOOR(AVG(sales)) AS average_sales 
FROM Sales
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY average_sales DESC;

Q4) What are the 5 sub categories that have the maximum profit margin in 2017?

SELECT sub_category, 
       FLOOR((SUM(profit)/SUM(sales))*100) AS profit_margin_percent 
FROM Sales

Q5) What is the YoY change in sales?

Letâ€™s answer this question by writing two 
sub queries and then joining it. We can use 
row_number to assign a number to every row 
and then use it to navigate to the adjacent 
rows to find the difference in sales between 
the previous and the current row.

WITH yearly_sales AS
(
  SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, 
         FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales,
         row_number() OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(order_date)) AS rn
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY order_year
  ORDER BY order_year
)
SELECT S1.order_year, 
       S1.sales,
       COALESCE(
                FLOOR(
                      ((S1.sales - S2.sales)/S2.sales) * 100
                     ), 0
               ) 
         AS YoY_Percent_Change_Sales
FROM yearly_sales S1
LEFT JOIN yearly_sales S2
ON S1.rn = S2.rn + 1;

mysql> WITH yearly_sales AS
    -> (
    ->   SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
    ->          FLOOR(SUM(sales)) AS sales,
    ->          row_number() OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(order_date)) AS rn
    ->   FROM Sales
    ->   GROUP BY order_year
    ->   ORDER BY order_year
    -> )
    -> SELECT S1.order_year,
    ->        S1.sales,
    ->        COALESCE(
    ->                 FLOOR(
    ->                       ((S1.sales - S2.sales)/S2.sales) * 100
    ->                      ), 0
    ->                )
    ->          AS YoY_Percent_Change_Sales
    -> FROM yearly_sales S1

Q6) What is the average dispatching time 
in each region in 2015, 2016 and 2017?

Dispatching time is the difference in time between 
the Shipped Date and Ordered Date. We can calculate 
this by using the DATEDIFF function and supplying 
the above two column names.

Let us write 3 sub queries to find the dispatching time 
for each of the years and then join those three tables 
by using a JOIN function as below.

WITH 
R1 AS
( SELECT Region,
  ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)),2) AS Dispatching_Time_2015
 FROM Sales
 WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2015
 GROUP BY Region
),
R2 AS
( SELECT Region,
  ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)),2) AS Dispatching_Time_2016
  FROM Sales
  WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2016
  GROUP BY Region
),
R3 AS
( SELECT Region,
  ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)),2) AS Dispatching_Time_2017
  FROM Sales
  WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
  GROUP BY Region
)
SELECT R1.Region,
       R1.Dispatching_Time_2015,
       R2.Dispatching_Time_2016,
       R3.Dispatching_Time_2017 
FROM R1
JOIN R2 ON R1.Region = R2.Region
JOIN R3 ON R2.Region = R3.Region;

mysql> WITH

Q7) Compare the sales in 2016 and 2017 by Sub Category.

Letâ€™s write two sub queries to find the sales 
by sub_category in 2016 and 2017. Weâ€™ll join 
these tables and then find the difference in 
sales between these years.

With 
S_2016 AS
(
  SELECT sub_category, FLOOR(SUM(Sales)) AS Sales_2016
  FROM Sales
  WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2016
  GROUP BY sub_category
),
S_2017 AS
(
  SELECT sub_category, FLOOR(SUM(Sales)) AS Sales_2017
  FROM Sales
  WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2017
  GROUP BY sub_category
)
SELECT S_2016.sub_category, 
       Sales_2016, 
       Sales_2017, 
       (Sales_2017 - Sales_2016) AS CY_vs_PY_Sales
FROM S_2016
JOIN S_2017 ON S_2016.sub_category = S_2017.sub_category
ORDER BY CY_vs_PY_Sales DESC;

mysql> With

    ->        Sales_2017,
    ->        (Sales_2017 - Sales_2016) AS CY_vs_PY_Sales

Q8) What are the top 2 sub categories 
    in every region by most sales?

Weâ€™ll utilize the window functions from this question 
(RANK, ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK, FIRST_VALUE etc.)

SELECT R2.* FROM
(SELECT R1.*, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Sales DESC) AS Sales_Rank FROM
(SELECT Region, sub_category, FLOOR(SUM(Sales)) AS Sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region, sub_category
ORDER BY Region, Sales DESC) R1)R2
WHERE R2.Sales_Rank < 3;
