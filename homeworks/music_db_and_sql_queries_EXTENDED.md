# Extended Schema (Music Streaming Analytics)

Extend this dataset with one or two more dimensions to simulate a real-world analytics case (e.g., streaming service dashboard).

For extended, can you provide a complete example, integrate subscriptions with users and play, complete schema, sample rows, 18 queries (6 simple, 6 intermediate, 6 with sub-queries using WITH and ranking functions)

Excellent ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build a complete, extended music streaming schema including subscriptions and devices, populate with sample rows, and provide 18 meaningful queries (6 simple, 6 intermediate, 6 advanced with WITH + ranking).
