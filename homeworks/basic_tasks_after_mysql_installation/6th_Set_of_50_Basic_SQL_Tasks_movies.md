# Movies Table & 50 SQL Queries


## Scenario

	OK, assume that I am a student at a college, 
	and I have installed mysql database successfully. 
	Now I am wondering what are my next learning steps. 
	
	Here is an interesting table (MOVIES) with less than 
	10 columns, and about 100 rows of data. Then provide
	50 natural language queries (in English), then provide 
	an equivalent SQL (in MySQL), then provide the out put 
	of a query so that I can validate my queries. 

‚úÖ. set you up:

    1.    One interesting table (less than 10 columns, 
          but rich enough to ask many questions).
          
    2.    ~10,000 rows of sample data (I‚Äôll generate a 
          dataset you can load easily).
          
    3.    50 natural language queries.
    
    4.    Equivalent MySQL queries.

## 1. Example Table: Movies

We‚Äôll use a Movies table (fun + easy to reason about).
