Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs wrap up your SQL learning roadmap with the final 20 advanced tasks (41‚Äì60).
These tasks will take you into views, indexing, transactions, stored procedures, window functions, and performance tuning ‚Äî the advanced features you‚Äôll eventually need in real-world projects.

‚úÖ Final 20 Advanced SQL Tasks

Views
    41.    Create a view for customer order totals

CREATE VIEW customer_totals AS
SELECT c.name, SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.name;

    42.    Query the view

SELECT * FROM customer_totals;

    43.    Update a view to show only customers spending > 1000

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_totals AS
SELECT c.name, SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING total_spent > 1000;

    44.    Drop the view

DROP VIEW customer_totals;


‚∏ª

Indexes
    45.    Create an index on customer email

CREATE INDEX idx_email ON customers(email);

    46.    Create a composite index on orders (customer_id, product_id)

CREATE INDEX idx_orders ON orders(customer_id, product_id);

    47.    Check if an index is used (EXPLAIN query)

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = 'alice@email.com';

    48.    Drop an index

DROP INDEX idx_email ON customers;


‚∏ª

Transactions
    49.    Start a transaction and insert an order

START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, product_id, quantity, order_date)
VALUES (1, 2, 3, '2025-09-23');

    50.    Rollback a transaction

ROLLBACK;

    51.    Commit a transaction

COMMIT;

    52.    Demonstrate transaction with multiple updates

START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE products SET price = price - 100 WHERE category = 'Electronics';
UPDATE customers SET city = 'Boston' WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;


‚∏ª

Stored Procedures & Functions
    53.    Create a stored procedure to get total spent by a customer

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerTotal(IN cust_id INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT c.name, SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_spent
  FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
  WHERE c.customer_id = cust_id
  GROUP BY c.name;
END //
DELIMITER ;

    54.    Call the stored procedure

CALL GetCustomerTotal(1);

    55.    Create a user-defined function to apply discount

DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION ApplyDiscount(price DECIMAL(8,2), discount DECIMAL(5,2))
RETURNS DECIMAL(8,2)
DETERMINISTIC
RETURN price - (price * discount/100);
//
DELIMITER ;

    56.    Use the function

SELECT name, ApplyDiscount(price, 10) AS discounted_price FROM products;


‚∏ª

Window Functions
    57.    Rank customers by total spent

SELECT c.name,
       SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_spent,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.price * o.quantity) DESC) AS rank_position
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.name;

    58.    Find running total of sales by date

SELECT order_date,
       SUM(p.price * o.quantity) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

    59.    Find average sales per customer using PARTITION

SELECT c.city,
       c.name,
       AVG(p.price * o.quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY c.city) AS city_avg
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

    60.    Find the previous order amount per customer (LAG)

SELECT c.name, o.order_date,
       SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS order_total,
       LAG(SUM(p.price * o.quantity)) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date) AS prev_order
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.name, c.customer_id, o.order_date;

‚úÖ By now, with 60 tasks, you‚Äôve touched nearly every important SQL concept:
    ‚Ä¢    Basics (1‚Äì20) ‚Üí Create, insert, select, joins, filters.
    ‚Ä¢    Intermediate (21‚Äì40) ‚Üí Updates, deletes, subqueries, constraints, aggregations.
    ‚Ä¢    Advanced (41‚Äì60) ‚Üí Views, indexes, transactions, procedures, window functions.

Would you like me to bundle all 60 tasks into a single structured SQL ‚Äúlearning workbook‚Äù file (with clear sections and comments), so you can run everything step by step inside MySQL?
