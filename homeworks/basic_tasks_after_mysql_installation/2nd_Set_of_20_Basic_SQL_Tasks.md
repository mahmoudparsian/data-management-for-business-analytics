SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM orders);

    35.    Find the customer who spent the most

SELECT name FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = (
  SELECT o.customer_id
  FROM orders o
  JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY o.customer_id
  ORDER BY SUM(p.price * o.quantity) DESC
  LIMIT 1
);

    36.    Find orders with quantity greater than the average quantity

SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE quantity > (SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM orders);

Advanced Joins
    37.    Find customers who havenâ€™t placed any orders

SELECT c.name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

    38.    List all products and who bought them (if any)

SELECT p.name AS product, c.name AS customer
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id

    39.    Self join (customers in the same city)

SELECT a.name AS customer1, b.name AS customer2, a.city
FROM customers a
JOIN customers b ON a.city = b.city AND a.customer_id < b.customer_id;

    40.    Join orders with product price and compute total per order

SELECT o.order_id, c.name, p.name AS product, (o.quantity * p.price) AS total
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

ðŸ‘‰ These next 20 tasks bring you from basic CRUD and joins into subqueries, constraints, and functions. Together, youâ€™ll cover most of whatâ€™s needed to be comfortable with SQL in real projects.

Would you like me to design the final 20 advanced tasks (tasks 41â€“60), focusing on views, indexes, transactions, stored procedures, and window functions â€” so youâ€™ll have a full 60-task SQL learning roadmap?
