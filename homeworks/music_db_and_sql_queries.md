# Music Database, SQL Queries, and OLAP Examples 



# 1. Data Story here...

	1. Provide a star schema with record 
	   examples in music industry: 
	   
	     users, music, plays. 
	  
	  Then provide a complete example of OLAP 
	  operations with roll-up, roll-down, slide, 
	  dice, and pivot. 
	
	2. Provide 2 queries for every olap operation.
	
	3. This example provides a **complete OLAP workflow** 
	   for a music streaming service, enabling insightful 
	   analysis of **user behaviors, music trends, and 
	   time-based patterns**.  


# 2. Star Schema for Music Streaming Analytics

A **star schema** in the music industry (for a music streaming service) consists of a 

* **fact table** (`plays_fact`) and 

* multiple **dimension tables** (`users_dim`, `music_dim`, `date_dim`).

## **A. Roll-Up (Aggregating Data Upward)**

	Roll-up aggregates data **from lower levels to higher levels** 
	(e.g., from months to quarters or years).

#### **Query 1: ROLL-UP: Total Plays by Quarter**

```sql
SELECT d.year, 
       d.quarter, 
       SUM(f.play_count) AS total_plays
FROM 
    plays_fact f
JOIN 
    date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY 
    d.year, d.quarter;
```

### **Query 2: ROLL-UP: Total Play Duration by Year**

```sql
SELECT d.year, 
       SUM(f.play_duration) AS total_play_duration
FROM 
       plays_fact f
JOIN 
       date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY 
      d.year;
```


### **Query 3: ROLL-UP: Total Plays by Quarter with Ranking**

```sql
with subquery as (
    SELECT d.year, 
           d.quarter, 
           SUM(f.play_count) AS total_plays
    FROM plays_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY d.year, d.quarter
)
SELECT year, 
       quarter, 
       total_plays, 
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY total_plays DESC) AS rank_by_quarter
FROM 
    subquery;

```

### **Query 4: ROLL-UP: Total Play Duration by Year with Running Total**

```sql
with subquery as
(
    SELECT d.year, SUM(f.play_duration) AS total_play_duration
    FROM plays_fact f
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY d.year
) 
SELECT year, 
       total_play_duration, 
       SUM(total_play_duration) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS running_total
FROM 
    subquery;
```

    FROM plays_fact f
    JOIN music_dim m ON f.music_id = m.music_id
    JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    WHERE d.quarter = 'Q1' AND d.year = 2024
    GROUP BY m.genre, m.song_name
) AS subquery
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

#### **Query 4: Roll-Down: Monthly Play Distribution for Top Songs**

```sql
SELECT year, 
       month, 
       song_name,

FROM plays_fact f
JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY ROLLUP(year, quarter, month);
```

### **E. Pivot (Transforming Data Representation)**
Pivot **converts row-based data into columns** for better comparison.

### **Query 1: Pivot: Monthly Play Counts as Columns**

```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN play_count ELSE 0 END) AS Jan_plays,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN play_count ELSE 0 END) AS Feb_plays,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN play_count ELSE 0 END) AS Mar_plays
FROM plays_fact f
JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY year;
```

### **Query 2: Pivot: Play Counts by Genre and Quarter**

```sql
SELECT 
    genre,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN play_count ELSE 0 END) AS Q1_plays,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN play_count ELSE 0 END) AS Q2_plays
FROM plays_fact f
JOIN music_dim m ON f.music_id = m.music_id
JOIN date_dim d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
GROUP BY genre;
```
