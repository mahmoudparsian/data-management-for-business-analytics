OKay, students are in the 2nd week of "Introduction to relational databases" and they have installed mysql and running basic queries. I want to have a comprehensive set of slides (in markdown format) and in the slides include basic fundamental examples of join operations. The schemas should be simple and show the power of joins with complete English/SQL queries. this should be self-contained tutorial on the join operations: the main focus should be on INNER join and with some clear examples of LEFT and RIGHT joins in MySQL environment. Let's be as comprehensive  as possible. This document should a blue print for learning the join operations.
