# University Data Model with Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)

This package demonstrates **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, and **many-to-many** relationships in MySQL.  
It includes: a short data story, a complete MySQL schema, sample rows, and **60 queries** (20 simple, 20 simple-to-intermediate, 20 intermediate using `WITH` and window/ranking functions).

---

## üìñ Data Story

A **university system** manages students, professors, and courses:

1) Each **student** has exactly one **student profile** holding sensitive info (DOB, national ID). This is a **one-to-one** relationship.  
   - `students` ‚Üî `student_profiles`

2) Each **professor** can teach multiple **courses**, but each course is taught by exactly one professor. This is a **one-to-many** relationship.  
   - `professors` ‚Üí `courses`

3) Each **student** can take many **courses**, and each **course** can be taken by many students. This is a **many-to-many** relationship.  
   - Implemented via the junction table `enrollments(student_id, course_id)`

## üóÇÔ∏è MySQL Schema

```sql
-- Clean start (optional)
