# Understanding `GROUP BY` in SQL

		The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group 
		rows that have the same values in specified 
		columns into a summary row. 
		
		This clause is typically used in conjunction 
		with aggregate functions (like COUNT(), SUM(), 
		AVG(), MIN(), MAX()) to perform calculations on 
		each group of rows, rather than on the entire 
		result set.

		How it works:
		
			**Grouping**: The GROUP BY clause divides the 
			rows of a table into groups based on the 
			values in one or more specified columns. 
			All rows with  identical  values  in  the 
			GROUP BY columns will belong to the same 
			group.

			**Aggregation**: Once the groups are formed, 
			aggregate functions can be applied to each 
			group. These functions then return a single 
			summary value for each group. For example, 
			SUM() will calculate the total for each group, 
			AVG() will calculate the average for each group, 
			and so on.

## 1. Introduction

* There are 3 countries (`USA`, `CANADA`, `GERMANY`).

* There are 2 teams: `RED` and `BLUE`.

* Consider the following table (called `scores`) representing the 
scores for `RED` and `BLUE` teams.

## 2. Database `dom_db`

Create a database called `dom_db`.

If you have already created this database, then no action is required.

## 3. Table Definition

Assuming that you have created a database called: `dom_db`.

```sql
USE dom_db;

CREATE TABLE scores (
   country VARCHAR(20),
   team    VARCHAR(20),
   score   INT
);


mysql> CREATE TABLE scores (
    ->    country VARCHAR(20),
    ->    team    VARCHAR(20),
    ->    score   INT
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.008 sec)

```

## 4. Table Population

```sql
INSERT INTO scores(country, team, score) VALUES
('USA', 'RED', 10),
('USA', 'RED', 20),
('USA', 'RED', 30),
('USA', 'BLUE', 20),
('USA', 'BLUE', 40),
('USA', 'BLUE', 70),
('CANADA', 'RED', 30),
('CANADA', 'RED', 60),
('CANADA', 'RED', 80),

('GERMANY', 'RED', 20),
('GERMANY', 'RED', 40),
('GERMANY', 'BLUE', 30),
('GERMANY', 'BLUE', 70);

mysql> INSERT INTO scores(country, team, score) VALUES
    -> ('USA', 'RED', 10),
    -> ('USA', 'RED', 20),
    -> ('USA', 'RED', 30),
    -> ('USA', 'BLUE', 20),
    -> ('USA', 'BLUE', 40),
    -> ('USA', 'BLUE', 70),
    -> ('CANADA', 'RED', 30),

    -> ('CANADA', 'BLUE', 10),
    -> ('CANADA', 'BLUE', 40),
    -> ('CANADA', 'BLUE', 90),
    -> ('GERMANY', 'RED', 20),
    -> ('GERMANY', 'RED', 40),
    -> ('GERMANY', 'BLUE', 30),
    -> ('GERMANY', 'BLUE', 70);
Query OK, 16 rows affected (0.001 sec)
Records: 16  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> select * from scores;
+---------+------+-------+
| country | team | score |
+---------+------+-------+
| USA     | RED  |    10 |
| USA     | RED  |    20 |
| USA     | RED  |    30 |

| GERMANY | BLUE |    30 |
| GERMANY | BLUE |    70 |
+---------+------+-------+
16 rows in set (0.001 sec)

```

## 5. The `GROUP_CONCAT()` function in MySQL

		To understand the GROUP BY in SQL, we will 
		use the GROUP_CONCAT() function.

		The GROUP_CONCAT() function in MySQL is an 
		aggregate function that concatenates strings 
		from a group of rows into a single string. 
		This function is particularly useful when 
		you need to combine related data from multiple 
		rows into a more concise format. 

## 6. SQL Queries using GROUP BY 


**1. Find the total score per country and order by total score**

```sql
SELECT country, 
       SUM(score) AS total_score
