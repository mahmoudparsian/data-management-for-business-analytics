## 🎓 Basics of Set Operations in Math

### `1. Union ( ∪ )`

    •    Definition: The union of two sets A and B is the 
         set of elements that are in A, or in B, or in both.
         
    •    Symbol: A ∪ B
    
    •    Example:

			
			A = {1, 2, 3}

			B = {3, 4, 5}

			A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

### `2. Intersection ( ∩ )`

    •    Definition: The intersection of two sets A and B is 
         the set of elements that are in both A and B.
         
    •    Symbol: A ∩ B
    
    •    Example:

			A = {1, 2, 3}

			B = {3, 4, 5}

			A ∩ B = {3}

### 3. Difference ( a.k.a. Except )

    •    Definition: The difference of two sets A – B 
         (also called A except B) is the set of elements 
         that are in A but not in B.
         
    •    Symbol: A – B or A \ B
    
    •    Example:

			A = {1, 2, 3}
			B = {3, 4, 5}
			A – B = {1, 2}
			B – A = {4, 5}

📝 Summary

    •    Union ( ∪ ) → “combine everything”
    
    •    Intersection ( ∩ ) → “common elements”
    
    •    Difference ( – ) → “what’s left in one set after removing the other”
