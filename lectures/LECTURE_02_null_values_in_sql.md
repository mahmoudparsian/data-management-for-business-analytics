# NULL value in SQL

	Explain the concept of NULL values in SQL, 
	give 3 slides with examples using MYSQL db

	üëç ‚Äî NULL is one of the most important (and 
	confusing) concepts in SQL.

üëâ These  slides cover:
    1.    Definition of NULL
    2.    How to test for NULL
    3.    Behavior of NULL in expressions & aggregates

# üìë Slide 1: What is NULL in SQL?

    ‚Ä¢    NULL means ‚Äúunknown‚Äù or ‚Äúmissing‚Äù value.
    
    ‚Ä¢    It is not 0, not empty string, and not false.
    
    ‚Ä¢    Any column can hold NULL if it was not given a value.

Example

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    department VARCHAR(20)
);


INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'HR'),
(2, 'Bob', NULL),
(3, 'Charlie', 'IT');
~~~

### üìä employees table:

~~~
id    name     department
1     Alice    HR
2     Bob      NULL
3     Charlie  IT
~~~

## üìë Slide 2: How to Check for NULL

    ‚Ä¢    You cannot use = or != with NULL.
    
    ‚Ä¢    Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.

#### Example-1: Find employees with no department

~~~sql
SELECT name 
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
~~~

‚úÖ Result:
    ‚Ä¢    Bob has NULL department ‚Üí found in first query
    
    
#### Example-2:  Find employees with a department assigned

~~~sql
SELECT name 
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NOT NULL;
~~~~

‚úÖ Result:
    ‚Ä¢    Alice, Charlie found in second query

## üìë Slide 3: NULL in Expressions & Aggregations

    ‚Ä¢    Any math or string operation with NULL ‚Üí results in NULL.
    
    ‚Ä¢    Aggregates:
    ‚Ä¢                 COUNT(*) counts all rows (ignores NULL).
    
    ‚Ä¢                 COUNT(column) ignores NULL values.

### Example

~~~mysql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       COUNT(department) AS dept_count
FROM employees;
~~~

‚úÖ Result:
    ‚Ä¢    total_rows = 3
    
    ‚Ä¢    dept_count = 2 
         (because Bob‚Äôs department is NULL, not counted)

## üìë Slide 4: Common Mistakes with NULL

#### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Using `=` or `!=` with NULL

~~~sql
-- WRONG: This will return no rows
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE department = NULL;
~~~

‚úÖ Correct way:

~~~sql
SELECT name 
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
~~~

‚∏ª

#### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Assuming NULL = NULL is true

    ‚Ä¢    In SQL, NULL is unknown.
    ‚Ä¢    NULL = NULL ‚Üí FALSE (actually ‚ÄúUNKNOWN‚Äù).
    ‚Ä¢    Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL instead.

‚∏ª

#### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Forgetting about NULLs in joins

~~~sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
  ON e.department = d.dept_name;
~~~

    ‚Ä¢    If department is NULL, 
         the row will not match any department.
         
    ‚Ä¢    Must handle with LEFT JOIN if you want 
         to keep those rows.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Key Rule: Always use
    ‚Ä¢    IS NULL to check for missing values
    ‚Ä¢    IS NOT NULL for present values
