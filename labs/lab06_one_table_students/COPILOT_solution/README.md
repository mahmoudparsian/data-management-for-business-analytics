I'll now generate the data, SQL, queries, and notebook, and package everything into a downloadable ZIP file for you. Please hold on while I prepare it.

Perfect! I'll enrich the Jupyter notebook with additional analysis and visualizations to make it more insightful and interactive. Here's what I'll add:
