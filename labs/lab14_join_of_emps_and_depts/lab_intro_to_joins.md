# Gentle Introduction to JOINs

Weâ€™ll:


* Create two simple tables.

* Insert a few rows.

* Provide 10 basic JOIN queries (with English + SQL + sample results).

* Provide 10 intermediate JOIN queries (with English + SQL + sample results).

* We will keep the data very small and simple so students can see exactly 
  whatâ€™s happening.

* âœ… This Lab on JOINs introduces students to 
INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL (via UNION), and CROSS 
joins, plus aggregates and self-joins.





## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Create a Database



```sql
CREATE DATABASE join_db;
```

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Create Table employees

```sql
USE join_db;

CREATE TABLE employees (

    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT

);
```

## ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Create Table departments

```sql
USE join_db;

CREATE TABLE departments (

    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)

);
```


## ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Insert Data into Both Tables


```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, department_id) 
VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1),
(2, 'Max', 1),
(3, 'Bob', 2),
(4, 'Charlie', 2),
(5, 'Diana', 3),
(6, 'Ethan', NULL);


INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) 
VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'IT'),
(3, 'Finance'),
(4, 'Marketing'),
(5, 'AI');

```

## ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Check content of Both Tables

```
mysql> select * from employees;
+--------+---------+---------------+
| emp_id | name    | department_id |
+--------+---------+---------------+
|      1 | Alice   |             1 |
|      2 | Max     |             1 |
|      3 | Bob     |             2 |
|      4 | Charlie |             2 |
|      5 | Diana   |             3 |
|      6 | Ethan   |          NULL |
+--------+---------+---------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from departments;
+---------+-----------+
| dept_id | dept_name |
+---------+-----------+
|       1 | HR        |
|       2 | IT        |
|       3 | Finance   |
|       4 | Marketing |
|       5 | AI        |
+---------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

output:

```
+-----------+-------+
| dept_name | count |
+-----------+-------+
