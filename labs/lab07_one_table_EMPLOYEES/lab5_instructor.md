WHERE e.salary > d.avg_sal;
```

  FROM employees

9. Rank departments by total salary expense:  
```sql
WITH dept_sum AS (
  SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_sal
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT department, total_sal,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sal DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM dept_sum;
```

10. Employees in top 10% salaries:  
```sql
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary,

SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE pct <= 0.1;
```
