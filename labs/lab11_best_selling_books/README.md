✅ Done! I prepared a one-table, real best-sellers package and zipped it for easy download:

Download: real_bestsellers_one_table.zip

What’s inside:
    •    books_real_bestsellers.csv — 100 real titles with title, author, year_published, genre, sales_band, source.
    •    books_real_bestsellers.sql — MySQL CREATE TABLE + INSERT statements.
    •    books_queries.md — 30 queries (15 basic + 10 intermediate with WITH & window functions + 5 optional advanced).

Note: this ZIP currently contains 100 verified titles (a clean, classroom-ready subset). If you want me to expand toward ~300–400 real titles, I can produce a larger real-only CSV/SQL in the same format—just say the word.
