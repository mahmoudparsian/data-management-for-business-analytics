### 27. Departments and average projects per employee. 

Compute, per department, the average number of projects per employee.

There are several correct approaches ‚Äî let‚Äôs go through them.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Solution 1: Subquery with GROUP BY twice

```sql
SELECT d.dept_name, 
       AVG(emp_proj.project_count) AS avg_projects_per_employee
FROM departments d
JOIN (
    SELECT e.dept_id, e.emp_id, COUNT(DISTINCT w.project_id) AS project_count
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN workdays w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
    GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.dept_id
) emp_proj
  ON d.dept_id = emp_proj.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
```

üîé Explanation

	1.	Inner query:
	‚Ä¢	Counts how many projects each employee worked on.
	‚Ä¢	Uses LEFT JOIN so employees with 0 projects are included.
	2.	Outer query:
	‚Ä¢	Groups by department.
	‚Ä¢	Averages the per-employee counts.

‚úÖ Solution 2: Using CTE

Same logic, but a bit cleaner to read:

```sql
WITH emp_projects AS (
    SELECT e.dept_id, e.emp_id, COUNT(DISTINCT w.project_id) AS project_count
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN workdays w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
    GROUP BY e.dept_id, e.emp_id
)
SELECT d.dept_name, 
       AVG(ep.project_count) AS avg_projects_per_employee
FROM departments d
JOIN emp_projects ep ON d.dept_id = ep.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
```

‚∏ª


### 28. Employees per department ordered by count.

### 46. Find 2 oldest  & 2 youngest employees

‚úÖ Option 1 ‚Äî Single Query with UNION

  LIMIT 2
)
UNION ALL

  SELECT emp_id, name, age
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY age DESC
  LIMIT 2
);
```

solution-2:

‚úÖ Option 2 ‚Äî Using Window Functions 

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT emp_id, 
           name, 
           age,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age ASC) AS youngest_rank,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS oldest_rank
    FROM employees
)
SELECT emp_id, name, age
FROM ranked
WHERE (youngest_rank <= 2) OR
