consider the movielens schema
with 4 tables: movies, ratings, tags, links

The schema is defined below:

movies: movieId,title,genres
ratings: userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
tags: userId,movieId,tag,timestamp
links: movieId,imdbId,tmdbId


Let's create the following set queries with English and 
associated SQL(using mySQL database).

1. set of 10 basic queries for novice users 
(make sure that the output of query will not be more than 30 records)

2. next set of 10 basic queries for novice users 
(make sure that the output of query will not be more than 30 records)

3. next set of 10 intermediate queries 
(make sure that the output of query will not be more than 30 records)

4. next set of 10 intermediate queries using sub-queries
   using "WITH" and ranking function
   (make sure that the output of query will not be more than 30 records)

5. next set of 10 complex (but meaningful)  queries using sub-queries
   using "WITH" and ranking function
   (make sure that the output of query will not be more than 30 records)
