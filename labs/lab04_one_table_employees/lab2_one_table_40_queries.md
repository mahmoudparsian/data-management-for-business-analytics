# Lab 2, using MySQL and SQL

Activities:

	1. Create a single simple table.

	2. Insert some rows.

	3. Provide 20 beginner queries (with English + SQL).

	4. Provide 20 intermediate queries (with English + SQL).




# ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Create Database & Table

#### Create Database:

~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE db2;
~~~

#### Now, Select your database for use:

~~~sql
USE db2;
~~~


#### Create Table wit 5 columns:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE employees (

    emp_id INT  PRIMARY KEY,

    name VARCHAR(50),

    age INT,

    department VARCHAR(50),

    salary INT

);
~~~



# ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Insert Sample Rows: 20 rows


~~~sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, age, department, salary) 
VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 30, 'HR', 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 25, 'IT', 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 28, 'Finance', 51000),
(4, 'Diana', 35, 'IT', 75000),
(5, 'Ethan', 40, 'Finance', 80000),
(6, 'Fiona', 29, 'HR', 52000),
(7, 'George', 32, 'IT', 62000),
(8, 'Rafa', 38, 'Sports', 180000),
(9, 'Denis', 69, 'Sports', 150000),
(10, 'Hamid', 52, 'HR', 96000),
(11, 'Max', 30, 'HR', 75000),
(12, 'Bo', 25, 'IT', 65000),
(13, 'Hasan', 28, 'Finance', 58000),
(14, 'Darya', 35, 'IT', 75000),
(15, 'Ed', 40, 'Finance', 80000),
(16, 'Ted', 35, 'AI', 175000),
(17, 'Darya', 25, 'AI', 165000),
(18, 'Hasan', 28, 'AI', 58000),
(19, 'Maz', 35, 'IT', 95000),
(20, 'Mo', 40, 'IT', 85000);
~~~

Now we have 15 employees in the table.
