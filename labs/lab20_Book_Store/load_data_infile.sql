-- Books-on-Cities â€” LOAD DATA INFILE scripts
-- Usage (CLI):
--   mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
-- Then inside MySQL:
--   USE books_on_cities;
--   SOURCE books_on_cities_schema.sql;   -- if not created yet
--   SOURCE load_data_infile.sql;

-- If LOCAL is not allowed, enable in client or server, or move CSVs into secure-file-priv directory.

-- Paths: When using LOCAL, MySQL reads from the CLIENT machine.
-- Place the CSVs in the same folder as your MySQL client or give absolute paths.
