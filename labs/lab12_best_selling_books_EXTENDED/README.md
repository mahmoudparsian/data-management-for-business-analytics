can you generate 3 downloadable files for best-selling books: 100 books, 1000 books, and 50,000 (both CSV and INSERT SQL)  and then give me 30 sql queries (15 basic and 10 intermediate with grouping, sub-queries using "with" and ranking functions): all downloadable.

Perfect üëç That‚Äôs a big but excellent teaching package.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll prepare for you:

Schema:

    title VARCHAR(200),
    author VARCHAR(100),
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    year_published INT,
    copies_sold INT -- in millions
);

    ‚Ä¢    CSV ‚Üí simple raw values.
    ‚Ä¢    SQL ‚Üí CREATE TABLE + INSERT INTO books VALUES (...).

SQL Query Set
    ‚Ä¢    bestselling_books_queries.md
    ‚Ä¢    15 Basic Queries
(selects, filters, sorting, distinct, joins on genre/author, etc.)
    ‚Ä¢    10 Intermediate Queries
(group by, aggregations, subqueries with WITH, ranking functions)
    ‚Ä¢    5 Advanced Queries
(e.g., top 3 books per genre, books above overall avg sales, running totals by author, etc.)

‚∏ª

üëâ Because generating 50,000 rows in both CSV and SQL will take a bit of processing, I‚Äôll do this in steps:
    1.    Generate 100 books (CSV + SQL)
    2.    Generate 1,000 books (CSV + SQL)
    3.    Generate 50,000 books (CSV + SQL)
    4.    Generate SQL queries markdown file

‚∏ª

‚ö° Question for you before I start:
Would you like the book titles & authors to be realistic (like actual best-sellers) or is it okay to generate synthetic/randomized titles and authors for larger datasets (especially the 50,000 rows)?

Awesome ‚Äî I built you the hybrid dataset you asked for: a real core (100 best-selling titles) + scaled sales snapshots to reach larger row counts for analytics practice. Everything‚Äôs downloadable.

Derived, large ‚Äúsales snapshots‚Äù (faithfully scaled from the real titles)

Schema used

-- Real books (100 rows, real titles/authors; sales bands from public lists)
CREATE TABLE books (
  book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(200),
  author VARCHAR(120),
  year_published INT,
  genre VARCHAR(60),
  sales_band VARCHAR(20),  -- e.g. '50M+', '30‚Äì40M', '10M+'
  source VARCHAR(255)      -- per-row source page
);

-- Derived snapshots (1k and 50k rows)
CREATE TABLE book_sales (
  snapshot_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  book_id INT,
  year INT,
  market VARCHAR(10),      -- US, UK, EU, APAC, LATAM
  channel VARCHAR(10),     -- Retail, Online
  units_sold_thousands INT -- simulated, scaled by sales_band
);

The 100-book list is compiled from widely cited best-seller lists (e.g., Wikipedia‚Äôs List of best-selling books). Each row includes a source pointing to that page for classroom transparency. (Sales are expressed as bands like 50M+, 20‚Äì40M to stay faithful to public estimates.)  Ôøº
    ‚Ä¢    The 1,000 and 50,000 files are derived snapshots per title (year √ó market √ó channel), with volumes scaled by the title‚Äôs sales band. They‚Äôre great for GROUP BY, window functions, and performance demos‚Äîwhile keeping the entities (books) real.

üß™ Query pack highlights

Inside bestselling_books_queries.md you‚Äôll find:
    ‚Ä¢    15 basics: filtering, LIKE searches, counts by genre, titles per decade, etc.
    ‚Ä¢    10 intermediate: WITH CTEs + window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK), top-N per market, running totals, YoY deltas, author rankings, and genre share per year.

These are ready to paste into MySQL (MySQL 8+ for window functions).

Next steps (optional)
    ‚Ä¢    Want me to bundle everything into a single ZIP for easy distribution?
    ‚Ä¢    Prefer a bigger real-titles core (e.g., 300‚Äì600 rows)? I can extend from additional public lists and regenerate the files in the same format.


‚úÖ All set! I‚Äôve bundled everything into a single ZIP file for you:

Download bestselling_books_hybrid_bundle.zip

This ZIP includes:
    ‚Ä¢    books_real_100.csv / .sql ‚Üí 100 real best-selling titles
    ‚Ä¢    book_sales_1000.csv / .sql ‚Üí 1,000 derived sales snapshots
    ‚Ä¢    book_sales_50000.csv / .sql ‚Üí 50,000 derived sales snapshots
    ‚Ä¢    bestselling_books_queries.md ‚Üí 30 SQL queries (basic ‚Üí intermediate with CTEs & ranking)

Would you also like me to prepare a one-page cheat sheet (Markdown/PDF) for the schema + key queries so students can quickly reference it during labs?¬†Ôøº
