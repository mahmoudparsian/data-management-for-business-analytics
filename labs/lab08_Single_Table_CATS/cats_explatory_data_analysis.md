Consider the following two tables in MySQL:

provide two downloadable:

1. python program to read employee table from mysql 
and then do expiatory analysis of this data, and then 
some basic group by of age, breed, country, gender.
: show graphs for understandings of data

2. the same thing as 1, but in jupyter notebook

CREATE TABLE cats (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        date_of_birth DATE,
        num_of_tricks INT,
        country VARCHAR(20),
        gender VARCHAR(10),
        breed varchar(20),  -- FK to breeds table
        age INT
);

CREATE TABLE breeds (
        breed varchar(20) PRIMARY KEY,
        description VARCHAR(128)
);

âœ… ready-to-use resources for your Cats schema (MySQL â†’ Pandas â†’ EDA):

Inside the zip:
    1.    cats_eda.py â€” Python program to:
    â€¢    Connect to MySQL
    â€¢    Load the cats table
    â€¢    Do exploratory analysis (head, info, missing values, summary)
    â€¢    Plot graphs (age distribution, gender distribution, average tricks by breed, cats by country)
    2.    cats_eda_notebook.ipynb â€” Jupyter Notebook with cells for:
    â€¢    Connection setup
    â€¢    Data loading
    â€¢    EDA (info, summary, missing values)
    â€¢    Graphs and group-by visualizations
    â€¢    Clean close of MySQL connection

âœ… Done! I added a breed-level summary table to the notebook, which includes:
	â€¢	number of cats per breed,
	â€¢	average age per breed,
	â€¢	average tricks per breed,
plus visualizations for average age and cat counts by breed.
