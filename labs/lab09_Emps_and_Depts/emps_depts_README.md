~~~

assume gender has 2 possible values: MALE and FEMALE
assume degree has 4 possible values: BS, MS, MBA, and PHD
assume that country has 10 possible values: USA, CANADA, ...
assume that hire_date range is from 2020 to 2025
assume that salary range is from 60000 to 160000

## 2. Departments

2. We have 10 departments, but only 8 of them are assigned to employees
and 2 of them are defined, but not used anywhere

~~~
dept_id, dept_name, location
~~~


## Tasks

The tasks we want to do are:

1. Define a mysql database schema, which covers our data story: 
lets keep everything as simple as possible

2. Populate these tables by CSV files (one file per table),
so our tables are: Employees and Departments.
The more records the better, but I do not want huge CSV files.

3. This is meant for LAB exercises (5 labs in total) by senior 
undergraduate students, who they have installed mysql database, 
but do not have exposure to databases and sql. I want to have these 
labs as progressive (starting with real basic, then basic, the 
intermediate, then intermediate 2, then advanced).  

For each lab, I want 30 English/SQL queries. I want these queries 
to be meaningful (not just random queries).

* Lab-1: very basic

* Lab-2: basic, some intermediate

* Lab-3: some intermediate, intermediate

* Lab-4: intermediate+

* Lab-5: intermediate to advanced

Please use markdown format for all of the lab sql queries

Can you please give all of this in a downloadable zip file.
