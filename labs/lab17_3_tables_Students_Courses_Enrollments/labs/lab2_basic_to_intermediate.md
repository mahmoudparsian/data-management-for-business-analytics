```sql
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE student_id=12 LIMIT 10;
```

### 5. Enrollments for courses 30..40.
```sql
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE course_id BETWEEN 30 AND 40 LIMIT 10;

GROUP BY e.course_id, c.course_name
ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### 9. Students with no enrollments (LEFT anti-join).
```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.name
FROM students s LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id=e.student_id
