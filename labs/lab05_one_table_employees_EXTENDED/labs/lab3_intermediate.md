### 1. Per department: total, avg, min, max salary.

```sql
SELECT department, 
       COUNT(*) AS n, 
       ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_sal, 
       MIN(salary) AS min_sal, 
       MAX(salary) AS max_sal 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;
```

### 2. Per country: total employees and avg age.
```sql
SELECT country, 
       COUNT(*) AS n, 
       ROUND(AVG(age)) AS avg_age 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY n DESC;
```

### 3. Per degree: avg salary, avg age.
```sql
SELECT degree, 
       ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_sal, 
       ROUND(AVG(age)) AS avg_age 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY degree 
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;
```

### 4. Per (country, department): headcount.
```sql
SELECT country, department, COUNT(*) AS n 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY country, department 
ORDER BY country, n DESC;
```

### 5. Departments with average salary between 90k and 120k.

solution-1: use HAVING

```sql
SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING AVG(salary) BETWEEN 90000 AND 120000;
```

solution-2: use sub-query and the WHERE

```sql
WITH avg_salary_per_dept AS
(
  SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department 
)
SELECT department, avg_salary 
FROM avg_salary_per_dept 
WHERE avg_salary BETWEEN 90000 AND 120000;
```

solution-3: use sub-query and the WHERE, and then AND

```sql
WITH avg_salary_per_dept AS
(
  SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department 
)
SELECT department, avg_salary 
FROM avg_salary_per_dept 
WHERE (avg_salary >= 90000) AND 
      (avg_salary <= 120000);
```


### 6. Countries with at least 2 degrees represented.

solution-1: use HAVING

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT degree) AS degree_per_country 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY country 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT degree) >= 2;
```

solution-2: use sub-query and the WHERE

```sql
WITH degree_per_country_table AS
(
  SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT degree) AS degree_per_country 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY country 
)
SELECT country, degree_per_country 
FROM degree_per_country_table
WHERE degree_per_country >= 2;
```



### 7. Top 3 departments by headcount.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS n 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY n DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

### 8. Bottom 3 departments by avg salary.

```sql
SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_sal 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY avg_sal ASC 
LIMIT 3;
```

### 9. For each country, count employees per age bucket (by 10s).

The `FLOOR()` function:

	The FLOOR() function returns the 
	largest integer that is less than 
	or equal to the numeric_expression. 
	
	SELECT FLOOR(25.75); -- Returns 25
	SELECT FLOOR(10);    -- Returns 10


```sql
SELECT country, 
       FLOOR(age/10)*10 AS age_bucket, 
       COUNT(*) AS n 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY country, age_bucket 
ORDER BY country, age_bucket;
```

### 10. Count of employees hired per year.
```sql
SELECT YEAR(hire_date) AS yr, 
       COUNT(*) AS n

```sql
WITH g AS 
(
  SELECT department, 
         SUM(CASE WHEN gender='MALE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS m, 
         COUNT(*) AS n
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT department, m*1.0/n AS male_ratio 
FROM g 
WHERE m*1.0/n > 0.5;
```

### 12. Avg salary per (degree, department).

LIMIT 1;
```

### 14. Degree with lowest average salary.
