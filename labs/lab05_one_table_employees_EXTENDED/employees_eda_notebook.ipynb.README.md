yes on extend this into a ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook with cells for connection, EDA, and plots â€” so you can run and visualize everything step by step more interactively

Awesome â€” I turned that into a ready-to-use Jupyter notebook with separate cells for connection, EDA, group-bys, and plots.

ðŸ““ Download it here: employees_eda_notebook.ipynb

Whatâ€™s inside:
    â€¢    Config cell for host/user/password/database/table.
    â€¢    Connect to MySQL and load the employees table into Pandas.
    â€¢    EDA: head(), info(), missing values, numeric summaries.
    â€¢    Categorical overview for degree, gender, country, department.
    â€¢    Plots (all with matplotlib):
    â€¢    Age histogram
    â€¢    Salary histogram
    â€¢    Gender count bar chart
    â€¢    Average salary by degree (bar)
    â€¢    Average salary by country (bar)
    â€¢    Employees per department (bar)
    â€¢    Age distribution per department (boxplot)
    â€¢    Optional cell to save all charts as PNGs to eda_charts/.
    â€¢    Cleanup cell to close the DB connection.

If you want, I can also add:
    â€¢    A section for outlier detection (e.g., IQR for salary),
    â€¢    Correlation matrix (age/salary) and scatter plot,
    â€¢    Export of group-by tables to CSV for your reports.Â ï¿¼
